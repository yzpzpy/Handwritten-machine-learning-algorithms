Handwritten machine learning algorithms with C++

**1. gradient_descent.cpp**

I used the definition method to calculate the differential of the loss function.I just used a univariate function as an example to write a gradient descent algorithm.

**2. batch_gradient_descent.cpp**

I changed the variable to be optimized into a vector type, which can be passed into a vector of any length, and directly use the derivative loss function to replace the process of differentiating the loss function to reduce the number of iterations when differentiating.
